Version History:

0_6:
============
* Requires Java 11 or later now.
* Fixed bug where routing might incorrectly report "no enough memory" [sic].
* Removed special font size fix for HiDPI screens, relying
  on Java 9 and later native HiDPI support (testing needed!)
* Much improved smoothness and general experience when dragging the map
* Add button to delete downloads in download dialog
* Generate submenus for favorite groups that contain one or more '/'.
  This allows sorting favorites in a hierarchy instead of just flat groups.
* Allow loading resources from files when there is no
  jar (easier development with some IDEs)
* Improve positioning of text, for example street names are now on the
  street instead of slightly off in various directions.
